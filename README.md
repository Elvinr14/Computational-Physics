Categorizing The Coma Cluster Galaxies
This code is designed to work off of The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Database. Of crouse there is a lot of importated that needs to be addressed, and because this is from the SDSS, as long as you use the same color magnitudes and parameters, then you should be able to replicate this data with other celestial bodies. 
This is not a guide by any means as it has taken me a while to barely come to grasp the coding that I am doing. Some of the stuff I just follow from SDSS guides they have on their website. 
Hopefully there is something useful in here for anyone that sees this. I will ofcourse upload the data that I import and an extra notebook file that is needed to see the redshift and velocity measurements.
